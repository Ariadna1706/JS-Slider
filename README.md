# Slider-JS

### :books: Project Overview 

Slider (gallery), launched after clicking on a given photo.
This project involved working with code written by another developer. The main intention of the project was to understand and modify
already existing code that will run the slider.

**Main features**:

Modification of the code consisted in applying ECMAScript2015 standards:
 - classes
 - template strings
 - arrow functions
 - The code has been divided into smaller parts (ES6 modules) to keep it better organized
